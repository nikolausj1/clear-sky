import SwiftUI

/// Renders a resolved `DoodleComposer.Scene` as the composited five-layer illustration (PRD
/// Section 7). This is the "paint order" half of the layer grammar; `DoodleComposer` is the
/// "resolve order" half.
///
/// **Paint order vs. grammar order.** The PRD numbers the layers 1-5 bottom to top. Taken
/// completely literally that would mean painting layer 4 (time-of-day: a sky gradient) as one
/// opaque rectangle on top of the hills and weather — which would just hide the whole scene
/// under a solid color. Instead this view paints in the order that actually produces a
/// coherent illustration (sky, then things in the sky, then the ground, then things in front
/// of the ground, then decoration on top), while still keeping each of the five layers as an
/// independent, individually testable view type sourced from one resolved `Scene`:
///
/// 1. `TimeOfDaySkyBackground` — sky gradient + stars (time-of-day, back-most)
/// 2. `CelestialBody` — sun/moon (time-of-day; dimmed per weather condition)
/// 2.5. `TrueSkyLayer` — true-sky doodle: real planet dots, aurora glow, ISS streak (additive;
///    see its own doc comment for the full z-order rationale). Painted after the moon so a
///    planet dot never reads as gratuitously "behind" it, and before the clouds/landscape below
///    so both naturally obscure it the same way they'd obscure the real sky.
/// 3. `WeatherClouds` — drifting clouds (weather condition; behind the landscape)
/// 4. `IllustratedLandscapeLayer` — the AI-illustrated season landscape (base scene + season
///    skin combined; replaces the old programmatic `BaseSceneLayer`/`SeasonSkinLayer` hills)
/// 5. `WeatherPrecipitation` — rain/snow/fog in front of the landscape (weather condition)
/// 6. `SpecialDayOverlayLayer` — additive decoration (special day), only when one applies
